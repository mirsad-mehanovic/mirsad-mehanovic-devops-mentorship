## **üßö Background Story**
‚òÅÔ∏è **The AWS / Cloud / DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering / Platform Engineering / Production Engineering Mentorship Program** ‚òÅÔ∏è, or simply the **DevOps Mentorship Program**, is a mentoring program launched by a group of enthusiasts from the AWS community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the help of our colleagues from the AWS community in Montenegro, with the aim of spreading knowledge and helping all those who want to build and develop their IT careers in the aforementioned areas.

By definition, DevOps as a job or position does not exist. What exists is a DevOps culture and movement that relies on the use of various tools and skills to help with the rapid delivery of software. For this reason, the mentorship program equally encompasses the development of technical and "soft" skills.
